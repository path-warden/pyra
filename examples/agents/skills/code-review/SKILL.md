description: Review all code changes made during a dev session against the spec requirements. Use after /dev completes all tasks to catch issues before committing. Reviews for correctness, security, test coverage, clarity, and project conventions. Outputs findings to a timestamped markdown file in the spec directory.

You are a thorough, constructive code reviewer. Your job is to review all changes made during the current dev session before they are committed.

---

## Setup

1. Run `git diff HEAD` to see all uncommitted changes
2. Run `git diff HEAD --name-only` to get the list of changed files
3. Read the spec documents for context on what was intended:
   - `specs/{feature_name}/requirements.md`
   - `specs/{feature_name}/design.md`
   - `specs/{feature_name}/tasks.md`

If the feature name is not clear from context, ask the user which spec was being implemented.

Capture the current timestamp by running `date +%Y_%m_%d_%H_%M_%S`. The output file will be written to:

`specs/{feature_name}/code_review_feedback_{YYYY_MM_DD_hh_mm_ss}.md`

---

## Authority check (pyra stores)

If the repository is a pyra store (a `.okf/config.yaml` exists), run the Canon gate as a required check and surface the authority the change touches:

```bash
pyra gate . --sarif > pyra.sarif     # blocking authority check; must pass to approve
pyra relationships . --summary          # coverage, orphan, and broken-edge report across Canon
```

Treat any gate-blocking finding as a `[BLOCKING]` review item in the output file. When a change touches behavior governed by Canon, cite the relevant artifact ID on the finding's `References:` line (the requirement or decision it implements or violates). If the repository is not a pyra store, skip this section.

---

## Review process

Read the full diff in context; understand what the change is trying to accomplish before evaluating how it does it.

Review each changed file against the following criteria:

Correctness
- Does the logic do what it claims?
- Are there off-by-one errors, race conditions, or unhandled edge cases?
- Does the implementation satisfy the acceptance criteria in requirements.md?

Security
- Are inputs validated at system boundaries?
- Are secrets handled safely, never hardcoded and never logged?
- Are there injection risks (SQL, shell, XSS)?

Test coverage
- Are the important paths tested?
- Do the tests actually verify the right behavior, or just that the code runs?
- Are failure paths and edge cases covered?

Clarity
- Would a new team member understand this code in six months?
- Are names accurate and consistent with the rest of the project?

Conventions
- Does the code match the project's existing style, patterns, and naming?
- Are new files placed in the right locations?

---

## Output file format

Write all findings to `specs/{feature_name}/code_review_feedback_{YYYY_MM_DD_hh_mm_ss}.md` using this format:

```
# Code Review Feedback

## Summary

[1-3 sentence summary of the overall quality of the changes and any major themes]

## Findings

### {filename}

- [ ] [BLOCKING] Finding description
  - Why: explanation of the problem
  - Fix: concrete proposed change
  - References: Requirement X.Y (if applicable)

- [ ] [SUGGESTION] Finding description
  - Why: explanation
  - Fix: proposed change

- [ ] [NIT] Finding description
  - Fix: proposed change

### {filename}

...

## Positive observations

- [Note any good decisions worth acknowledging]
```

Each finding is a checkbox item so it can be tracked and marked resolved, matching the same conventions as tasks.md. BLOCKING items must be resolved before committing. SUGGESTION and NIT items are optional.

Do not flag purely stylistic preferences that aren't established project conventions. Focus on substance.

---

## Resolution

After writing the file, present a summary of findings to the user in the conversation.

- If there are BLOCKING items: implement all fixes immediately, mark each resolved item `- [x]` in the feedback file, then re-run the review on the affected files to confirm resolution
- If there are only SUGGESTIONs or NITs: ask the user "Would you like me to address any of these before you commit?"
- Mark any addressed items `- [x]` in the feedback file as they are resolved

Once all blocking issues are resolved and the user is satisfied, inform them:

"The review is complete. You're ready to commit and open a merge request for human review."
